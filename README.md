Project 1 : SkyDrop — an advanced, futuristic drone delivery service website and discussion for Human Centered Artificial Intelligence.

I designed and developed this dynamic, fully animated web experience to demonstrate the future of fast, eco-friendly deliveries. From real-time order tracking with live drone animations to a smart price calculator and an interactive fleet status dashboard, SkyDrop provides a seamless and engaging user journey.

Key features include:
✅ Smooth hero animations and floating drones to capture attention.
✅ Order form with live price breakdown and delivery time options.
✅ Real-time package tracking simulation and live map.
✅ Fleet monitoring section showing active drones and battery statuses.
✅ Clean, modern UI with gradient text effects, hover interactions, and smooth scrolling for an immersive feel.


This project combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with advanced animations and interaction logic, showcasing how technology can revolutionise last-mile delivery experiences.
